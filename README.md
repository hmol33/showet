# showet

Demo viewer using Pouet.net's metadata

Consider this "MAME for demos"

Developed on Ubuntu (17.10 - 22.10), other platforms may work.

## Idea

- Browse and search demos using pouet.net's database
- Select a demo, it will be downloaded and set up
- Easily run the demo natively or using emulator (fs-uae, or retroarch) or wine
- Support at least linux, windows .exe (wine), Amiga (UAE), C64 (Vice) demos
- Smart autodetection as far as possible
- Support per-demo metadata to define how it should be run if autodetection fails

## Current implementation

- Python script that can download & run demos
- Supported platforms: windows .exe, Amiga (.adf, .dms, .lha), C64 (d64|d71|d80|d81|d82|g64|g41|x64|t64|tap|prg|p00|crt|bin|zip|gz|d6z|d7z|d8z|g6z|g4z|x6z|cmd|m3u|vfl|vsf|nib|nbz|d2m|d4m)
- GUI frontend

## Usage

- Install the debian package (available in github releases page)
- Launch showet from menu
- Search for a production and click run to run it
- Alt-F4 quits from emulators

### Amiga Notes

For Amiga demos you'll need kickstart rom files. See
http://fs-uae.net/docs/kickstarts on how to obtain and install those.

Setup fs-uae default settings to your liking - it'll be used as
base for launching amiga demos.

### C64 Notes

supported_extensions = "d64|d71|d80|d81|d82|g64|g41|x64|t64|tap|prg|p00|crt|bin|zip|gz|d6z|d7z|d8z|g6z|g4z|x6z|cmd|m3u|vfl|vsf|nib|nbz|d2m|d4m"

Vice shipped with Ubuntu doesn't contain kernal files due to
copyright reasons.

- Go to http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/index.html#download and download
  the source tarball.
- Create directory ~/.vice
- Copy everything from tarball's data/ directory to ~/.vice

You can configure vice / x64 any way you want. Showet starts it
with -fullscreen by default

Use Alt-N to cycle disk sides for multi-disk demos.

## Todo

- [x] Proof of concept
- [x] Windows support
- [x] Amiga support
- [x] C64 support
- [ ] DOS support (almost working)
- [ ] Linux support (almost working)
- [x] GUI
- [x] unzip decompress
- [x] unrar decompress
- [x] tar/gz/lhA decompress
- [ ] Design metadata format to fix non-working demos
- [x] Disk change support (C64/Amiga)
- [x] debian packaging
- [ ] Whitelist & blacklist of known working & broken demos

Pull requests welcome.

## Command line examples
